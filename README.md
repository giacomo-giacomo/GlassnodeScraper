### ðŸ“Œ Overview
Web3 promotes transparency, openness, and public utility. Yet, accessing relevant on-chain data and metrics is often far from straightforward â€” even on platforms that claim to support these values.

### ðŸ”§ Features
-Logs into Glassnode using Selenium and saves session cookies
-Bypasses the 30-day data limitation for non-authenticated users
-Extracts on-chain metrics by sending requests to specific XHR endpoints
-Currently configured for Polygon metrics (modifiable)
